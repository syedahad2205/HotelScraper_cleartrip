# HotelScraper_cleartrip

My very first project while learning kotlin and getting into road to learn FP and stuff. 
It's a very noob project, Please look into this as if 5yo has coded this. 

---very much string dependent on extracting data  
---using jsoup to parse webpages  
---using opencsv to write to csv


Also, this takes a long long time to complete cause there is no threading :) enjoy hf.
